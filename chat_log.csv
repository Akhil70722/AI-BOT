2025-08-28T16:24:42.333166,e20fa23b,who is the captain of indian cricket teamn in 2025 ?,"Predicting the captain of the Indian cricket team in 2025 is tricky! It depends on many factors, including:

*   **Rohit Sharma's performance and fitness:** As of now (October 26, 2023), Rohit Sharma is the captain in all formats. If he continues to perform well and remains fit, he *could* still be captain in 2025, although he would be getting older.

*   **Emergence of new leaders:** A strong, capable leader could emerge in the coming years through their performances, leadership qualities, and ability to inspire the team.

*   **Selectors' decisions:** Ultimately, the decision rests with the selectors. They will consider all of the above factors.

**Potential Candidates:**

Given the current situation and speculation, some potential candidates (besides Rohit Sharma) *could* include:

*   **Hardik Pandya:** He has captained India in T20Is and some ODIs, and is seen as a potential leader. However, his fitness and consistency are key.

*   **KL Rahul:** He has captained India in the past, and while his place in the team isn't always guaranteed, he remains a possibility.

*   **Jasprit Bumrah:** Although fast bowlers are not often captains, Bumrah has captained India in a Test match.

*   **Rishabh Pant:** Before his accident, Pant was seen as a future captain. If he recovers fully and regains his form, he could be a contender.

*   **A young player (Unlikely, but possible):** It's possible that a younger player who is not currently a prominent figure could rise through the ranks and establish themselves as a leader.

**In short, it's impossible to say definitively who the captain will be in 2025. It will depend on many evolving factors.**",N/A,N/A
2025-08-28T16:25:15.105690,8386c418,write a program in js for adding two numbers,"```javascript
// Method 1: Using a function

function addNumbers(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}

// Example usage:
let number1 = 5;
let number2 = 10;
let sum = addNumbers(number1, number2);
console.log(""The sum of "" + number1 + "" and "" + number2 + "" is: "" + sum); // Output: The sum of 5 and 10 is: 15


// Method 2:  Directly adding numbers without a function

let a = 20;
let b = 7;
let result = a + b;
console.log(""The sum is: "" + result); // Output: The sum is: 27


// Method 3: Using arrow function (more concise)

const add = (x, y) => x + y;

//Example Usage
let num_1 = 12;
let num_2 = 8;

console.log(`The sum of ${num_1} and ${num_2} is: ${add(num_1, num_2)}`);  // Output: The sum of 12 and 8 is: 20


// Method 4:  Getting input from the user (prompt) -  Requires a browser environment

/*
let input1 = prompt(""Enter the first number:"");
let input2 = prompt(""Enter the second number:"");

// Convert the input strings to numbers using parseFloat (or parseInt if you only expect integers)
let num1 = parseFloat(input1);
let num2 = parseFloat(input2);

if (isNaN(num1) || isNaN(num2)) {
  console.log(""Invalid input. Please enter numbers only."");
} else {
  let sum = num1 + num2;
  console.log(""The sum is: "" + sum);
}
*/


// Explanation and Key improvements:

* **Function Approach:** The `addNumbers` function is the most structured and reusable way to add numbers.  It takes two arguments (the numbers to add) and returns their sum. This is good practice for code organization.

* **Direct Addition:** The second method demonstrates the most basic way to add two numbers directly. This is suitable for simple, one-time additions.

* **Arrow Function:**  The third method uses an arrow function, which is a more concise syntax for defining functions in JavaScript. This is a modern and commonly used approach.

* **Input from User:** The fourth method (commented out because it relies on `prompt` which is browser-specific) shows how to get input from the user. It's important to use `parseFloat` or `parseInt` to convert the input strings to numbers before adding them.  Also includes error handling for non-numeric input.

* **Error Handling:** The `isNaN()` function checks if the input is ""Not a Number"".  This is crucial for handling cases where the user enters text instead of numbers.  Without this check, your program might produce unexpected results (like `NaN`).

* **Output:** All methods clearly print the result to the console using `console.log()`.

* **Template Literals:**  The example with the arrow function uses template literals (backticks ``) to create the output string.  This is generally cleaner than concatenating strings with the `+` operator.

* **`parseFloat` vs. `parseInt`:**
    * `parseFloat` converts a string to a floating-point number (a number with decimal places).
    * `parseInt` converts a string to an integer (a whole number).  Choose the appropriate function based on whether you need to handle decimal values or not.

How to run the code:

1. **In a browser's developer console:** Open your browser's developer tools (usually by pressing F12).  Paste any of the above code snippets into the console and press Enter.  The output will be displayed in the console.

2. **In Node.js:**
   - Save the code to a file (e.g., `add.js`).
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you saved the file using the `cd` command.
   - Run the code using the command: `node add.js`

3. **Using an online JavaScript editor:**  There are many online JavaScript editors available (e.g., CodePen, JSFiddle, JS Bin).  Paste the code into the editor and run it.",N/A,N/A
